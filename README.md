# month-of-zen-tracker
A quick script to figure out when different episodes of The Daily Show might come up during the Month of Zen

# Usage
The tracker starts off showing you the current Real Time and the show that is currently on the stream.  Type a date into either field, and the opposite field will update with the corresponding time.

Roadmap:
- Add Datetime pickers
- Fix dataset to eliminate need for offset
- Firefox support
