	<p>This is quick script to figure out when different episodes of The Daily Show might come up during the Month of Zen.  If it's showing you the wrong time, try clicking Reset Local Storage</p>
	<p>The source data is available in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ms_fn981stFyci3_KUW9pOZTZn2vIml_i6CRY7qnrM0/edit?usp=sharing">public google doc</a>, and was sourced from <a href="http://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&id=71256&lid=7">The TV DB</a>, and <a hef="">Wikipedia</a></p>
	<p>I then converted the sheet to CSV, <a href="http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm">then to JSON</a>, which sits <a href="episodes/all.json">here</a></p>
	<p style="color:red">OPEN CALL FOR HELP: If anyone (at TDS) knows what episodes were cut from the stream, get in touch and help me keep this thing on track!</p>
	<h1>Usage</h1>
	<p>The tracker starts off showing you the current Real Time and the show that is currently on the stream. Type a date into either field, and the opposite field will update with the corresponding time.</p>
	<p>Sorry, no firefox support.</p>
	<div style="margin-top:25px;">I timed the episodes from the stream at 24 minutes even, meaning that about 180 episodes were cut.  But which ones?!  I've introduced a start offset to try to account for this.  Until I can figure out which episodes were cut, I'll have to manually keep the offset up to date over time. The Reset button will rebuild your local database, in case I've changed things, or if you're working on developing the tool.  If the start offset is wrong, try setting a new one in the console by typing something like moztrack.startOverride = new Date(2015,5,26,5,0); to adjust the override, and click Reset Local Storage.  If you see the right show pop up, you have the right offset!<br>Feel free to <a href="mailto:matt@matt-schoen.com">contact me</a> with questions or corrections, or fork this project on github!</div>
	<p>Finally, for some shameless self-promotion.  My name is <a href="http://matt-schoen.com">Matt Schoen</a>, and aside from being a huge fan of TDS, I also make games and stuff.  You should also check out my company, <a href="http://defectivestudios.com/">Defective Studios</a>!</p>
	<p class="fine-print">This page probably doesn't merit a privacy policy, but let it be known that it uses Google Analytics to track page views, dates entered into the text field, and clicks to the Reset button.</p>
